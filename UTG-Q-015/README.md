**NAME:**  
UTG-Q-015
  
**Description**:   
In December 2024, the Qi'anxin Threat Intelligence Center disclosed the malware-infected attacks on several top websites in China. The attacker group behind this attack was named UTG-Q-015. UTG-Q-015 is a Southeast Asian-based attacker group that provides penetration and intelligence services to Southeast Asian companies and government agencies. They are highly familiar with Chinese and its context.

In 2025, UTG-Q-015 changed its tactics and began exploiting zero-day and next-day vulnerabilities to compromise government and enterprise websites. In March, it deployed a batch of scanning nodes to conduct brute-force attacks against government and enterprise targets. In April, we observed UTG-Q-015 carrying out large-scale malware-infected attacks on web systems such as blockchain websites, digital signature backends, Bitcoin backends, and GitLab backends, affecting some government and enterprise organizations. Furthermore, they targeted financial institutions through IM phishing attacks and used their C2 to connect back to an intranet web address to download a three-stage payload.
