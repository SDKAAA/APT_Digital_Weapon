**NAME:**  
Curly COMrades
  
  
**Description**:   
The group's earliest attack activities can be traced back to mid-2024. Suspected to be from Russia, the attacks primarily targeted judicial, government institutions, and the energy sector in Georgia and Moldova. In this attack, Curly COMrades established multiple network entry points using proxy tools such as Resocks, SSH, and Stunnel, maintained long-term access with the MucorAgent backdoor, stole credentials from the NTDS database and LSASS memory, and used legitimate websites as traffic relays to mask malicious activities.
