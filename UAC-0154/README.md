**NAME:**  
UAC-0154
  
**Alias**  
STARK#VORTEX
  
**Description**:   
UAC-0154 is a Russian-speaking threat group that has long targeted Ukrainian military and political targets. Securonix recently tracked it as the initiator of the STARK#VORTEX operation. The group has continuously updated its tactics, using documents disguised as Ukrainian drone training manuals (.chm) and "international partner" decoy documents. They also downloaded the MerlinAgent backdoor from platforms like catbox.moe via multi-level obfuscated PowerShell scripts, and disguised themselves as popular programs like Minecraft to achieve persistence and C2 communication. Their attack chain has received almost no detections on VirusTotal, demonstrating a strong ability to evade detection.
