**Description**:   
This APT group's earliest attacks date back to 2020. Suspected of originating from North Korea, it primarily targets US targets in the blockchain, cryptocurrency, online gambling, and cybersecurity sectors. It employs social engineering tactics through recruitment to trick potential victims into running GitHub projects containing malicious npm dependencies, or directly delivers malware through messaging or file-sharing platforms. This group shares significant overlap with Lazarus.
