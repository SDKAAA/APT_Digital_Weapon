**Description**:   
Operation Cobalt Whisper is a cyber espionage campaign targeting defense, energy, and research sectors primarily in Hong Kong and Pakistan. The threat actors leverage malicious LNK files and VBScript to deliver Cobalt Strike beacon payloads for C2 communication. Key features include obfuscated beacon execution, scheduled task persistence, and disguise as legitimate system files (ImeBroker.exe). The campaigns show sophisticated anti-analysis techniques and focus on high-profile industrial targets.
