**Description**:   
ForumTroll is a cyber threat group leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities for targeted attacks, primarily against Russian media, educational institutions and government organizations. The attacks are delivered via personalized phishing emails exploiting a high-risk Chrome zero-day CVE-2025-2783 to bypass sandbox protections. Kaspersky noted the complexity of the attack chain and the use of short-lived malicious links masquerading as 'Primakov Readings' academic forum invitations.
